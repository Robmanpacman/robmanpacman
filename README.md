# Projects
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in data analysis. Each project focuses on a specific problem or domain and showcases my ability to extract meaningful insights and present them in a clear and concise manner. Some examples of my work include:<br/>
 - **Movie Analysis**: A project utilizing Python and Beautiful Soup to web scrape movie data from the IMDB website, extract relevant information such as ratings, genres, and cast details. Then transforming and loading the data into an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis.
    
- **Resturant Database**: I developed a comprehensive restaurant database using MySQL and Python. By leveraging the mysql.connector library, I established a seamless connection between Python and MySQL, allowing for efficient data population and retrieval. Furthermore, I delved into sales trends, employing Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities to visualize and interpret the data.

- **NBA Salaries**: Through this analysis of NBA player salaries, I provided valuable insights into the financial landscape of the league during the specified period, offering a deeper understanding of player compensation trends. I merged the power of Excel and Tableau for this project.
